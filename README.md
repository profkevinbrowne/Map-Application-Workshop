# Map Application Workshop

## Purpose
This is a workshop intended to teach beginner programmers the basics of building a "map application" using Bing Maps in a computer lab enviornment.  

## Background 
It was designed for high school students that have already completed an HTML/CSS course and an introductory Java programming course.  But it is being released publicly in case it is useful for anyone else.

## Workshop Preperation
To prepare the workshop, you will need to get a Bing Map API Key from here: https://www.bingmapsportal.com/.  You will need to insert the key into the Bing Map script tag at the bottom of the **map.html** and **map_complete.html** files.  You will need to make these files publicly available somewhere (e.g. on Google Drive, shared using a link) or give them to students in advance (e.g. on a USB drive).  You will need to add these links to the workshop step-by-step document where it is highlighted in red/yellow.  You will also need to insert the Bing Map key into the step-by-step document where the script tag from the map.html file is highlighted.

It is also recommended that you print a copy of the step-by-step intructions for each workshop attendee.

## Workshop Delivery
The workshop is delivered in a computer lab with a projecter / podium computer.  The workshop presenter can go through the document step-by-step, entering in the code themselves and showing the results, while also having the students do the same on their own workstations/computers.  The presenter can spend more time explaining the sections of code with concepts students are more likely to be unfamilar with.  After completing each section in the document, before moving onto the next section, the presenter can move around the room and help students out as they get stuck (mostly with syntax isues).  

It's intended to take about one hour to deliver, with any remaining time left for students to experiment and customize their application.  

Of course you can deliver it however you like, this is just a recommended approach!
